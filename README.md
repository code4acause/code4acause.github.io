##  Purpose
We want to bring awareness and change to our community through coding and **hacking**.  
 
We aim to participate in multiple hackathons throughout the year. We will learn the basic **low-code** hackathon skills and discuss potential social hacking projects during our weekly meet.
 
## When and where do we meet
Meetings will be held on Thursdays, both physically and virtually. We will either discuss a hackathon skill and learn it together, or discuss a social issue (such as education, health, climate change, inequality, etc) and how to solve it with technologies.
 
Please contact Darren Weng <dw1001528@students.westportps.org> or Gabriel Weng <gw1001530@students.westportps.org> to be added to the newsletter distribution and Discord server.
 
Date/Time : 3:30 pm virtually on Thursdays.
Room : Discord
Teacher : TBD
 
## What we did
 
In our first year, we have managed to
 
- Published a weekly newsletter that highlights the social issues and different technologies involved in hackathons
- Won the Most Innovative Award in PrideHack II with solutions that use Web3 and DAOs on blockchains to empower grassroots advocacy to change the world to be more inclusive. to make LGBTQ+ activism more accessible, equitable, and ultimately more impactful.
- Won 1st Place at Lockheed Martin Code Quest 2022 Advanced Division.
- Two members also interned at Harvard’s Coronavirus Visualization Team in the summer, and we learned some data science and visualization tools (pandas, streamlit, etc) and techniques. We plan to use what we learned for most of the projects next year.
 
## What we plan to do
 
This year, we plan to:
 
- Continue to publish a weekly or bi-weekly newsletters.
- Recruit new members.
- Continue to host weekly virtual meets.
- Each month, we will focus on one project that addresses an social issue, currently we have the following areas in mind:
    - Education – college and social mobility
    - Inequality – zip code and economic data
    - Climate Change – electricity usage prediction
    - Bioinformatics – Solve some DNA puzzle with coding
    - Blockchain and Democracy – e.g. Secured and anomalous voting
    - Microaggression - Use NLP to analyze conversations on Discord server (popular among Staple students)
